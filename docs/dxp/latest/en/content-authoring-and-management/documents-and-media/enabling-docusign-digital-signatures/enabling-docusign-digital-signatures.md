# Enabling DocuSign Digital Signature

You can now integrate [*DocuSign*](https://www.docusign.com/) digital signature into your Liferay documents. DocuSign is a service that manages documents to be signed electronically. With this integration, you can manage and collect signatures on your documents.

Before you enable digital signature in Liferay, make sure you've generated and retrieved your User ID key, API Account key, Account Base URI, Integration key, and RSA Private key. Instructions for doing this can be found on [DocuSign's website](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-admin-guide-api-and-keys). 

## Enabling Digital Signature

1. Open the Global menu on the top right corner. ![Global Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)

1. Switch the *toggle* to Enable.

    ![Your Site Settings Strategy defines the scope of your digital signature.](./images/02.png)

1. Click *Save*. 

You have three options for your Site settings strategy: 

**Always Inherit:** All sites are linked to these settings.

**Always Override:** Every site must provide its own configuration.

**Inherit or Override:** Can be defined in both site settings and instance settings. If defined in both, the site settings will override those of the instance.

You now must add your digital keys from DocuSign at the proper scope in Liferay. 

## Adding Digital Keys

Depending on what you chose for your Site Settings strategy, you must add your digital keys at the proper scope: 

- If you chose Always Inherit, add the keys in Instance Settings. 
- If you chose Always Override, add the keys in Site Settings. 
- If you chose Inherit or Override, add the keys in either place.

1. Navigate to _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Instance Settings_ &rarr; _Digital Signature_ or for Site Settings, the _Site Menu_ &rarr; _Configuration_ &rarr; _Site Settings_ &rarr; _Digital Signature_. 

1. If it's not switched already, switch the toggle to _Enabled_.
