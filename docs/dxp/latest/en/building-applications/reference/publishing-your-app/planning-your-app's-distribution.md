When you start the formal process of submitting your app to the Marketplace, in addition to uploading your app’s files you must answer a host of important questions. For example, you must clarify who owns the app, specify pricing for the app, define its licensing scheme (if it’s a paid app), associate a person or company as its owner and maintainer, and specify the versions of Liferay that the app supports. Your answers to these questions help you determine if you must package multiple versions of the app. This tutorial prepares you by explaining the questions and ways you might answer them. Here’s what’s covered:
