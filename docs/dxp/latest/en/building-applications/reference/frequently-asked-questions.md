| What is a Liferay App? | <details><summary>`Expand`</summary>Liferay apps are packages of "plug-ins" (portlet, hook, theme, etc.) that you can install into a Liferay portal installation to modify or extend Liferay's out-of-the-box functionalities. Some apps, like Liferay's Social Office, are developed, tested, and supported by Liferay. Third-party apps are developed, tested, and supported (if subscription services are offered) by other members of the broader Liferay community. Many official Liferay apps, as well as some third-party apps, are available free of charge. Other apps require you to pay a fee in order to access them and/or associated subscription services.</details> |
| What is an Instance Unit? | <details><summary>`Expand`</summary>An Instance Unit is a unit of measure used to define pricing for certain Liferay Marketplace apps.

| Are Liferay Apps Fully Tested? | <details><summary>`Expand`</summary>Official Liferay apps (developed, tested, and supported by Liferay) go through the same level of coding and testing rigor that Liferay Portal goes through. Every third-party app submitted to the Liferay Marketplace is reviewed by our team to ensure that certain standards for information are upheld and the app installs as expected. However, we cannot actively monitor nor guarantee the content or functionality of any third-party app in the Marketplace. Also, any technical or support-related question related to a third-party app should be directed to the third-party app developer.</details> |
| How Do I Request a Refund? | <details><summary>`Expand`</summary>Generally, all app sales are considered to be final. However, we do believe that developers should stand by their products. If an app fails to do what it says it will do, first contact the developer through the support information provided in the app description page. We find that in many cases, constructive dialogue resolves the issue or clears up any misunderstanding. You can also check out the Marketplace Forum(Opens New Window) to see if your issue has been discussed. If you are unable to reach the developer after reasonable attempts, you can contact us using the Marketplace [Contact Form(Opens New Window)](https://www.liferay.com/pt/contact-us). We are only able to consider refund requests within 30 days of purchase date.</details> |
| How Do I Get Support for My App? | <details><summary>`Expand`</summary>Liferay apps designated as "EE" (Enterprise Edition) apps are supported for Liferay Portal Enterprise Edition subscribers. The type and level of support for EE apps will depend on the [Enterprise Edition subscription tier(Opens New Window)](https://www.liferay.com/pt/subscription-services). Support may or may not be offered for third-party apps. Please be sure to confirm whether or not the developer is offering support for a third-party app before purchasing it. For supported third-party apps, please use the "Support" link provided on the right-hand side of the app description page. An overview of the Marketplace support policy is given below. <!--descobrir como colocar a tabela--> </details> |
| What are the Different Types of Support Offered with Third-party Apps? | <details><summary>`Expand`</summary>Third-party developers for the Marketplace have the option of offering or not offering subscription services with their apps. Subscription services consist of support, maintenance, and updates. Buyers should read the app description carefully to determine if the app offers subscription services that meet their support needs. Depending on how the third-party app is licensed, you may be offered the following options around subscription services: If the App has a Perpetual License 1. The developer may offer annually renewable subscription services, and it will be priced on a "per Instance Unit per year" basis. The first year of subscription services is included with a perpetual license. After that, the buyer will need to renew subscription services at the developer's price. Buyers will be entitled to support, maintenance, and updates as long as they continue to renew subscription services annually. 2. The third-party developer may offer no subscription services with their app, and buyers will be entitled to only app updates if and when updates become available. If the APP has a Non-Perpetual (Annual/Renewable) License 1. The developer may offer annually renewable subscription services, which is built into the "per Instance Unit per year" price of the non-perpetual license. Buyers will be entitled to support, maintenance, and updates as long as they continue to renew their license annually. 2. The developer may opt not to offer subscription services, and buyers will be entitled to only app updates if and when updates become available, as long as they continue to have a valid non-perpetual license. </details> |
