As you develop apps, you may want to sell them to or share them with consumers. You can distribute your apps on the Liferay Marketplace. The process is straightforward, but must make some decisions along the way and prepare your app for publishing on the Marketplace.

This section’s first tutorial explains Liferay Marketplace-related concepts and informs you of decisions to make before starting the publishing process from your portal. Then you’ll learn how to get resources, such as your app’s icon, screenshots to show off your app, and a comprehensive description of your app, ready for the publishing process. After that, you’ll learn the step-by-step process of submitting your app to the Marketplace. Lastly, you’ll learn how to monitor your app’s success on Liferay Marketplace and modify or add new versions of your app to the Marketplace.
