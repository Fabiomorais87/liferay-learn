The Liferay Marketplace is a vibrant hub for selling, sharing, and downloading Liferay Portal-compatible applications. Marketplace apps allow Liferay users to easily and efficiently deploy additional functionality and accelerate time-to-market. Liferay users can check out the [Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) and browse our collection of apps--hundreds are available and the number is growing daily!

For developers, the Marketplace is the ideal place to showcase apps and distribute them through half-a-million-plus worldwide Liferay deployments. The Marketplace leverages the entire Liferay ecosystem for developing, sharing, and transacting apps in a user-friendly, one-stop site.
