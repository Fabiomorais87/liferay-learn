# Managing Elements

To create new Elements, click the Add (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) button. See [Creating Elements](./creating-elements.md) for more details.

To delete existing custom Elements, select the Element(s) using the checkbox selector and click the Delete (![Delete](../../../../images/icon-trash.png)) button.

```{note}
System (i.e., out-of-the-box) Elements cannot be edited or deleted. Duplicate a system Element if you would like to create a custom Element based on it.
```

To duplicate an existing Element, click the Actions (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) button and select _Copy_. The duplicated Element can be deleted or edited just like any other custom Element.

To export an Element, click the Actions (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) button for the Element and select _Export_.

To import an Element, click the Actions (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) button in the top corner of the screen (next to the Global Menu icon). Click _Import_ and browse to the Element's JSON file.

```{warning}
The [Element schema](./creating-elements.md#understanding-the-element-schema) can change. If the schema changes between Liferay versions, importing the older Element's JSON may fail.
```
